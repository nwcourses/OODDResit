// CartItem
//
// Represents an individual item in the shopping cart.
//
// Each cart item stores the product, plus the quantity the user desires.
// 
// Note that this class is different to Product. Product is designed to store 
// information about each product in the shop, including its quantity in stock,
// but CartItem is designed to store an item WHILE IN THE CART
// (so it needs information about how many items of the product the user would 
// like)

// TODO You need to complete this class
